# Earthquake Map - Leaflet Challenge
In this project, I created a map of all earthquakes detected over the last thirty days with a magnitude over 2.5. The data is available from the USGS here: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php. The relavent files are contained in the Leaflet-Step-1 folder. Below is a description of the files in this repository.

### Leaflet-Step-1
- index.html: html page to display the map
- static
    - css: contains style.css to give give style to divs used
    - js: contains config.js and logic.js. Config.js stores the key for mapbox. Logic.js builds the maps
